Hello my name is David Baldwin.
I am twenty two years old.
I am a senior at UT Knoxville. 
My sister is twenty years old.

	I have worked for GeekSquad before.
	It was okay, but only worked 4 months.
	I installed, shipped, received, and
	sold computers.

	My friend Sharon Jenice Johnson and 
	Cornelia Nicole Chislom helped me
	develop this book. I hope the best for
	them in this world.
