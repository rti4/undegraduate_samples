SVN #14 commitment


-I created the boolean operation AndExp and OrExp but I am not sure if 
I implemented them correctly.

-I copy and pasted what she gave for the interpreter code and it should work

-I created the VarExp using what I designed for the hash.java file i created
earlier...the VarExp file should work fine 

-RowRef has been created it should work
-UndefinedCellException has been created it should work

-Exp works as well and Binary Exp  should have no problem working
- I took them from small driver test I had created using my code when I
thought you still had yet to submit the parser....Kristy's interpreter 
cleared up a question I had.



-====What we need ====
--So what do we need...you need to go over the code and look and see if it makes sense...see if u can make it look better...add comments, etc

We still need Interpreter to work various inputs, I have yet to implement that functionality...I think it woiuld take 2 hours max to do that....
Im not sure if  I will be up at 8:00am but I do know I will be in class for sure...
